Me, Brady Sligar, and Chance Spradley worked on the creation of this website. While i was tasked with the creation of the more design related elements, including the sitemap, logo, wireframe, and a variety of other this added onto the website; Chance was in charge of the bulk of the programming, HTML, and CSS. We both contributed heavily to this project and we found it to be both rewarding and engaging, as we embarked on a journey to create the best possible website we could for the timespan we were given, and we believe that we've done just that. The only problems we faced throughout our work lied in the resources we were given for the competition, as some of the AI generated car pictures were difficult to work with, but we attempted our best in overcoming this challenge.
